# Things to work on still:
# 1. Changing states, I haven't figured out how to get only some people to die
# 2. Adding recoveries and re-infections
# 3. Adding some kind of vaccine after some point in time - make it harder
# to get infected
# 4. Convert the entire thing to a function - so user can specify parameter values

# This code defines the characteristics of the 1st agent, who has some sickness,and also sets the population size, and then adds the exposed agent to the broader population.

# Note:
# ID = index of the ith agent
# State = Infection Status (Susceptible = S, Exposed = E, Infected = I, Recovered = R, Dead/Dying = D)
# Meeting = P(Meeting other agents) drawn from a uniform distribution [0,1]
# TimeE = Time exposed - we will use this later on for determining who gets infected, who recovers, and who dies

Population <- 1000

Agent1 <- data.frame(
  ID = 1,
  State = "E",
  Meeting = runif(1, 0, 1),
  TimeE = 1,

)


# Here, it loops across time, using the parameter values - Meeting and Population, to look at how agents meet, how many they meet, and how/whether or not their state changes
# if they come in contact with an exposed person.

# Note:
# There is a lot going on in this chunk - basically, it calculates how many other people they will meet - this is the parameter value * P(Meeting Others) + 1, where the + 1 avoids zeros - I don't want those. I also add a decision rule, where i randomize within a cut-off, which determines whether your state changes or not - this is a resistance type of parameter. The cut-off is a parameter we set - hardcoded at 0.2 for now.
